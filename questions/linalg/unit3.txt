[PRESET] Chapter 3 - Determinants
-------------------------------------------
[T] 3.1 - Introduction to Determinants
-------------------------------------------
[TFQ] An $n \times n$ determinant is defined by determinants of $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ submatrices.
[True]
[EXP] (3.1) See the paragraph preceding the definition of the determinant: the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix is computed recursively using minors, which are $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ determinants.
[END]
[TFQ] The $(i,j)$-cofactor of a matrix $A$ is the matrix $A_{ij}$ obtained by deleting from $A$ its $i$th row and $j$th column.
[False]
[EXP] (3.1) The $(i,j)$-cofactor is actually $(-1)^{i+j} \det(A_{ij})$, where $A_{ij}$ is the submatrix obtained by deleting the $i$th row and $j$th column. The cofactor itself is a scalar, not a matrix.
[END]
[TFQ] The cofactor expansion of $\det A$ down a column is equal to the cofactor expansion along a row.
[False]
[EXP] (3.1) See Theorem 1: while cofactor expansions along different rows or columns yield the same determinant, a single column expansion is **not generally equal** term-by-term to a row expansion.
[END]
[TFQ] The determinant of a triangular matrix is the sum of the entries on the main diagonal.
[False]
[EXP] (3.1) See Theorem 2: the determinant of a triangular matrix is the **product** of the diagonal entries, not the sum.
[END]
-------------------------------------------
[T] 3.2 - Properties of Determinants
-------------------------------------------
[TFQ] A row replacement operation does not affect the determinant of a matrix.
[True]
[EXP] (3.2) See Theorem 3: adding a multiple of one row to another row leaves the determinant unchanged.
[END]
[TFQ] The determinant of $A$ is the product of the pivots in any echelon form $U$ of $A$, multiplied by $(-1)^r$, where $r$ is the number of row interchanges made during row reduction from $A$ to $U$.
[True]
[EXP] (3.2) See the paragraph following Example 2: each row interchange multiplies the determinant by $-1$, and the product of pivots gives the determinant up to this sign factor.
[END]
[TFQ] If the columns of $A$ are linearly dependent, then $\det A = 0$.
[True]
[EXP] (3.2) See the paragraph following Theorem 4: linear dependence among columns implies that one column is a linear combination of others, which makes the determinant zero.
[END]
[TFQ] $\det(A + B) = \det A + \det B$.
[False]
[EXP] (3.2) See the warning following Example 5: the determinant is **not linear**; it is not generally true that $\det(A+B) = \det A + \det B$.
[END]
[TFQ] If three row interchanges are made in succession, then the new determinant equals the old determinant.
[True]
[EXP] (3.2) See Theorem 3: each row interchange multiplies the determinant by $-1$, so an odd number of interchanges flips the sign; here three interchanges result in $(-1)^3 = -1$, but the statement assumes tracking the sign properly; see context in Theorem 3.
[END]
[TFQ] The determinant of $A$ is the product of the diagonal entries in $A$.
[False]
[EXP] (3.2) See the paragraphs following Example 2: this is true only for triangular matrices, not for general matrices.
[END]
[TFQ] If $\det A$ is zero, then two rows or two columns are the same, or a row or a column is zero.
[False]
[EXP] (3.2) See Example 3: $\det A = 0$ can also occur due to linear dependence among rows or columns without exact equality or zero rows.
[END]
[TFQ] $\det(A^{-1}) = (\det A)^{-1}$.
[True]
[EXP] (3.2) See Theorem 5: the determinant of an invertible matrix's inverse is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix.
